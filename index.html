			<h4>Monster Fonts</h4>
				<p>Although <em class ="bodoni">Bodoni</em> and <em class ="didot">Didot</em> fueled their designs with the calligraphic practices of their time, they created forms that collided with typographic tradition and unleashed a strange new world, where the structural attributes of the letter—serif and stem, thick and thin strokes, vertical and horizontal stress—would be subject to bizarre experiments. In search of a beauty both rational and sublime, <em class ="bodoni">Bodoni</em> and <em class ="didot">Didot</em> had created a monster: an abstract and dehumanized approach to the design of letters.</p>
				<p>With the rise of industrialization and mass consumption in the nineteenth century came the explosion of advertising, a new form of communication demanding new kinds of typography. Type designers created big, bold faces by <em class ="vanlanen">embellishing</em> and <em class ="tripoli">engorging</em> the body parts of classical letters. Fonts of astonishing height, width, and depth appeared—expanded, contracted, shadowed, inlined, fattened, faceted, and floriated. <em class ="egyptian">Serifs</em> abandoned their role as finishing details to become independent architectural structures, and the vertical stress of traditional letters canted in new directions.</p>
				<p>Lead, the material for casting metal type, is too soft to hold its shape at large sizes under the pressure of the printing press. In contrast, type cut from wood can be printed at gigantic scales. The introduction of the combined pantograph and router in 1834 revolutionized wood-type manufacture. The pantograph is a tracing device that, when linked to a router for carving, allows a parent drawing to spawn variants with different proportions, weights, and <em class ="american">decorative excresences</em>.</p>
				<p>This mechanized design approach treated the alphabet as a flexible system divorced from calligraphy. The search for archetypal, perfectly proportioned letterforms gave way to a new view of typography as an elastic system of formal features (weight, stress, stem, crossbars, serifs, angles, curves, ascenders, descenders). The relationships among letters in a typeface became more important than the identity of individual characters.</p>
				<blockquote><p><em>“ </em>Printing, having found in the book a refuge in which to lead an autonomous existence, is pitilessly dragged out into the street by advertisements.... Locust swarms of print, which already eclipse the sun of what is taken for intellect in city dwellers, will grow thicker with each succeeding year.<em>”</em> <span class ="designer"> — <a href="https://saladofpearls.wordpress.com/2018/11/13/attested-auditor-of-books-and-teaching-aid-by-walter-benjamin/" target="_blank">Walter Benjamin</a></span> <time>[1925]</time></p></blockquote>

			<h4>Reform and Revolution</h4>
				<p>Some designers viewed the distortion of the alphabet as gross and immoral, tied to a destructive and inhumane industrial system. Writing in 1906, Edward Johnston revived the search for an essential, standard alphabet and warned against the “dangers” of exaggeration. Johnston, inspired by the nineteenth-century Arts and Crafts movement, looked back to the Renaissance and Middle Ages for pure, <em class ="helvetica">uncorrupted</em> letterforms.</p>
				<p>Although reformers like Johnston remained romantically attached to history, they redefined the designer as an intellectual distanced from the commercial mainstream. The modern design reformer was a critic of society, striving to create objects and images that would challenge and revise dominant habits and practices.</p>
				<p>The avant-garde artists of the early twentieth century rejected historical forms but adopted the model of the critical outsider. Members of the De Stijl group in the Netherlands reduced the alphabet to perpendicular elements. At the Bauhaus, Herbert Bayer and Josef Albers constructed letters from basic <em class ="futura">geometric</em> forms—the circle, square, and triangle—which they viewed as elements of a universal language of vision.</p>
				<p>Such experiments approached the alphabet as a system of abstract relationships. Like the popular printers of the nineteenth century, avantgarde designers rejected the quest for essential letters grounded in the human hand and body, but they offered austere, theoretical alternatives in place of the solicitous novelty of mainstream advertising. Assembled like machines from modular components, these experimental designs emulated factory production.</p>
				<p>Yet most were produced by hand rather than as mechanical typefaces (although many are now available digitally). <em class ="futura">Futura</em>, completed by Paul Renner in 1927, embodied the obsessions of the avant garde in a multipurpose, commercially available typeface. Although Renner disdained the active movement of calligraphy in favor of forms that are “calming” and abstract, he tempered the geometry of <em class ="futura">Futura</em> with subtle variations in stroke, curve, and proportion. Renner designed <em class ="futura">Futura</em> in numerous weights, viewing his type family as a painterly tool for constructing a page in shades of gray.</p>
				<blockquote><p><em>“ </em>The calming, abstract forms of those new typefaces that dispense with handwritten movement offer the typographer new shapes of tonal value that are very purely attuned. These types can be used in light, semi-bold, or in saturated black forms.<em>”</em> <span class ="designer"> — <a href="https://www.grapheine.com/en/history-of-graphic-design/typography-futura-paul-renner" target="blank">Paul Renner</a></span> <time>[1931]</time></p></blockquote>

			<h4>Type as Program</h4>
				<p>Responding in 1967 to the rise of electronic communication, the Dutch designer Wim Crouwel published designs for a “new alphabet” constructed from straight lines. Rejecting centuries of typographic convention, he designed his letters for optimal display on a video screen (CRT), where curves and angles are rendered with horizontal scan lines. In a brochure promoting his new alphabet, subtitled “An Introduction  for a Programmed Typography,” he proposed a design methodology in which decisions are rule-based and systematic.</p>
				<p>In the mid-1980s, personal computers and low-resolution printers put the tools of typography in the hands of a broader public. In 1985 Zuzana Licko began designing typefaces that exploited the <em class ="lores21">rough grain</em> of early desktop systems. While other digital fonts imposed the <em class ="lores9">coarse grid</em> of screen displays and <em class ="lores12">dot-matrix</em> printers onto traditional typographic forms, Licko embraced the language of digital equipment. She and her husband, Rudy VanderLans, cofounders of Emigre Fonts and Emigre magazine, called themselves the “new primitives,” pioneers of a technological dawn.</p>
				<p>By the early 1990s, with the introduction of high-resolution laser printers and outline font technologies such as PostScript, type designers were less constrained by low-resolution outputs. While various signage systems and digital output devices still rely on <em class ="lores9">bitmap</em> fonts today, it is the fascination with programmed, geometric structures that has enabled <em class ="lores9">bitmap</em> forms to continue evolving as a visual ethos in print and digital media.</p>

			<h2>Response to Ellen Lupton</h2>
			<p>Michael&nbsp;French <time>[2025]</time></p>

		<section class="response1">
			<p>In <em>Thinking with Type</em>, author Ellen Lupton presents an overview of the creation of modern typography, from its calligraphic roots and the invention of the printing press to modern screen-based, variable type. I chose to reflect on a specific portion of this overview which summarizes the evolution of typography from its 1800s departure from calligraphic traditions, through its reformation period in the early 1900s, and eventually to screen-optimized typography in the late 1900s. This period in typographic history has always been of particular interest to me because of the dramatic political and societal occurrences, such as the industrial revolution of the rise of facism in Europe, that drove major changes in the field.</p>
			<p>Lupton’s review of this time period suggests that typography is a pivotal connection between the historical occurrences of an era and the broader design aesthetics and vernaculars that define it. For example, 1800s European industrialization is reflected in the mechanized wood type that was developed during the time. Because advertising as a medium was entirely new, designers were competing to stand out and thus reaching for more offbeat typefaces. These eccentric wood typefaces became a staple of design at the time, moving far beyond the advertising world. The same goes for the modular, geometric systems developed in the early 1900s at schools like Bauhaus and De Stijl, and the pixel-based systems of the late 1900s. All design aesthetics throughout these eras were dramatically influenced by the qualities of popular typography at the time.</p>

		<section class="response2">
			<p>Despite being 15 years old, this excerpt from <em>Thinking with Type</em> touches on a lot of topics that are still relevant in the design industry today. Lupton describes the aforementioned late 1800s mechanized design approach as an “elastic system of formal features.” This concept of elasticity is paramount in modern design, especially in regard to responsive interfaces with adaptive typography. “Rule-based” and “systematic” type design, proposed in 1967 by Wim Crouwel, is conceptually foundational to the modern variable typefaces we have today. Through her summary Lupton suggests that typography is about systematic thinking, which is central to good digital interaction design.</p>
			<p>The only critique I can make of this excerpt on account of its age is that Lupton’s view of typography focuses a bit narrowly on visual aesthetics. Many contemporary digital designers have to contend with user concerns, like accessibility, that are not as big of a concern in print. This, however, is likely just a further result of the industry’s move away from print as a medium.</p>
			<p>Lupton’s review of typographic history demonstrates that typography is inseparable from technological innovation, as well as historical and cultural context. The latter is a particularly important takeaway for me as a designer, as I know that understanding the roots of typography will allow me to make more informed design decisions that will eventually lead to innovation.</p>
